# Chillisoft-6weeks-license-finder
Creates a list of customers who's eset licenses are soon to expire within 6 weeks. 

Note: This does not include the login information for security purposes. 

This can be used by any Chillisoft reseller to automatically get a list of the customers who might expire soon.

Common issues:
-The ChromeDriver doesn't match your chrome version. Find your version [Here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads), and put it in the same directory as the exe. 
-Does nothing - it is possibly you need to install python, and pip install the following: beautiful soup, pyautogui, openpyxl, selenium, tkinter - not entirely sure
-Gets to the end, but the excel doesn't update -- I think you have to delete the old xlsx file first!
